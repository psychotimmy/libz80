# libz80
libz80 library - EmulatorKit / RC2040 compatible version
========================================================

Tim Holyoake, February 2024.

This library takes the EmulatorKit / RC2040 forks of the libz80 library as of February 2024 and fixes a number of issues.

The library now passes all except one of the zexdoc test suite and all bar three of the zexall test suite (as found in yaze-ag 2.51.3).
Unsurprisingly, both these test suites pass in their entirety when run on actual RC2014 hardware. For all practical purposes however,
the failing tests are unlikely to impact anything running on an RC2040 under CP/M 2.2 - unless you know differently!

Building and Installing
-----------------------

The Makefile creates `libz80.so`, which together with `z80.h` make up the binary
package. `make install` installs these files in `/usr/lib` and `/usr/include`
respectively.

Emulation code itself is generated by the `codegen` directory. `mktables.spec`
includes a specification of the opcodes, using regular expressions to express
similar opcodes in a compact way. Binary representation of the opcodes is listed
in `opcodes.lst`. This makes tweaking the 'processor' relatively easy, as it
isn't done manually.

Pre-generated files are included - these are `opcodes_decl.h`, `opcodes_table.h`
and `opcodes_impl.c` in the `codegen` directory.
